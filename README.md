# Calculator
This calculator was built using Python
Python module(s) used were Tkinter

When coming up with a lesson plan for my students I wanted to create a calculator using Tkinter. I ended up creating a simple version of a calculator that took inspiration from the calculator app on Windows 10. 

## Calculator Window

* When user hits any of the number buttons they appear on the screen
* User can perform four basic math operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* User can use +/- button to change the sign of the first number or second number depending on which number the user is on
* User can add decimal places to the number using . button
* User can delete the most recent item on the screen using DEL button
* User can input two numbers with an operation then call upon another operation immediately instead of using the equals button every time
